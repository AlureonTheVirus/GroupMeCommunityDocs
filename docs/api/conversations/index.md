# Conversation Features

While Groups and Direct Messages have distinct management endpoints, they share a rich set of features for interaction within a chat. This section documents the API endpoints that are common to all types of conversations, whether it's a large group or a one-on-one DM.

Here, you'll find information on how to interact with features like message reactions, calendar events, pinned messages, and shared media galleries. These endpoints typically use a generic `:conversation_id` in their path, which can be substituted with either a `group_id` or a DM's `conversation_id`.
