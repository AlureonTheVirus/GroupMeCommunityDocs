# Uploading Media

GroupMe provides its own Content Delivery Network (CDN) to host images, videos, and other files that can be attached to messages. To send a message with a media attachment, you must first upload the file to the appropriate GroupMe service. This process will return a URL on the GroupMe CDN that you can then use in your API calls.

This is a two-step process:

1.  **Upload:** Send your media file to the correct upload service.
2.  **Attach:** Use the URL returned in Step 1 to create a message with an `image`, `video`, or `file` attachment.

## Upload Services

Each type of media has a specific endpoint and set of requirements.
