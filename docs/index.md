description: Community-led effort to document the reverse-engineered GroupMe API.
---

## Welcome to the OpenGM Project

This is the community-driven, open-source documentation for the GroupMe Public API. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for developers looking to build on the GroupMe platform.

### Why this project?

- **Up-to-Date:** The official documentation is extremely outdated. We strive to keep our docs current with the latest API changes.
- **Community-Powered:** Anyone can contribute! If you find an error or a missing endpoint, you can help improve the docs for everyone.
- **Rich Examples:** These docs are here to provide practical code samples and way more detail than the official docs ever did make development easier.
- **High Coverage:** These docs cover nearly all endpoints, including those not documented by GroupMe.
