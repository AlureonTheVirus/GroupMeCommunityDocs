# Overview

GroupMe has a thriving developer community which has created a variety of applications, bots, and tools. However, while the platform has constantly matured, the public documentation has not. In an effort to help other developers understand and utilize the platform better, this is a community-led effort to document everything possible. If you discover something not listed here, or you find an error in what is listed, please bring it up on the discussion page or submit a pull request.

Much of this information is pulled from [dev.groupme.com](https://dev.groupme.com/), which is the official GroupMe developers site. However, most of its information is outdated or incomplete, so please help keep this repo up-to-date.

If you have any questions or would like to get in touch, please join the [GroupMe API Development Group](https://groupme.com/join_group/27317261/ibNNhx) or open an issue.
