## About This Project

The GroupMe platform has a vibrant developer community, but the official API documentation has not kept pace with the platform's evolution. This project is a community-led effort to create a comprehensive, accurate, and up-to-date resource for anyone building on the GroupMe API.

Here you will find:

-   ‚úÖ **Complete Endpoint Reference:** Detailed documentation for the v3, v4, and other unlisted API endpoints.
-   üìö **In-Depth Guides:** Clear explanations of core concepts like the WebSocket gateway, attachments, and the emoji system.
-   ü§ñ **Practical Examples:** Working bot examples to help you get started quickly.
-   ‚ú® **Undocumented Features:** Information on hidden parameters, event types, and API behavior not found anywhere else.

> [!important]  
> **Disclaimer:** This documentation is a community effort and is not officially associated with, or endorsed by, GroupMe or Microsoft.
