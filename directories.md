# School Directories

For simplicity, this documentation will not cover how to join a campus domain via the API, but it does discuss how to navigate and manage one once you're a member. 

Unless otherwise stated, endpoints are relative to https://api.groupme.com/v3/ and must include the token of the user making the call - so, for example, if an endpoint is `GET /groups`, the request you make should be using the URL `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

URLs which include a variable, such as `GET /groups/:id`, have their variables marked with a colon. So a request to that endpoint would look like `https://api.groupme.com/v3/groups/1234567?token=aSDFghJkl`, where `1234567` is replaced with the group's ID, and `aSDFghJkl` is replaced with the user's token.

Finally, all responses are wrapped in a response envelope of the following form:

```
{
  "response": {
    "id": "12345",
    "name": "Family"
    ...
  },
  "meta": {
    "code": 200,
    "errors": []
  }
}
```

If the request succeeds, `meta.errors` will be null, and if the request fails, `response` will be null.

## Index Members

Return a list containing all of the users who are visible to you within the campus directory. Note that the responses you get are also dependant on the privacy status of other users in the directory. Some people have their profiles set to be visible to only their major or graduation year, or hidden entirely.
